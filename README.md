# BE-Bot

BE-Bot is a fun and interactive Discord bot project. It's not just a moderation bot, but also a fun bot with games and a shop system. This bot is my first Discord bot project and it's written in Python using Discord API v1 and was launched to public on May 4th 2021.

## Features

- **Moderation**: Helps manage your server with ease, provides server info, user info, kick/ban/unban users with a command.
- **Games**: Includes games like Rock Paper Scissors, featuring both single and multiplayer modes. And has some other "minor" ways to collect BE Coins.
- **Shop System**: Allows users to interact with a virtual shop.
- **Random Lucky Games**: Adds an element of surprise with random games.
- **Fun Purpose Bot**: Ensures the server remains lively and engaging.

## Note

This bot is no longer under review and it may be outdated after the release of Discord API v2. This is a re-written version of the bot and not the original script, as the original had many personal keys and functionalities using personal API structures.
